			<h2>TWITCH INTERFACE ANALYSIS</h2>
			<p>
			<img src="images/twitchinterface.png" width="600" class="twitch">
			<p>
Twitch is a live streaming video platform for gamers. This is good design because it meets almost all needs within the design hierarchy.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Functionality:</strong> The website does it's job, meaning I came here to watch people play games and that's what I see.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Reliability:</strong> The website functions consistently, however, the reliability of viewing videos will depend on the users own Internet connection. If many users are watching the same live stream, it is possible that the server will crash.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Usability:</strong> The navigation system is very easy to maneuver around. Users can easily accomplish basic tasks, such as logging in, playing or pausing a video, or finding games to watch. The content is well organized making it easy to browse for popular games and the text is readable.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Proficiency:</strong> The website is semi-proficient. Twitch has features where you can share, follow, subscribe (pay money), or even chat with users, making the design intuitive. Almost all social media websites have this same formula nowadays because they know it works. 
However, there is a lack of proficiency because there is no advanced search option when searching for games. The search is filtered by the most viewers a game has, making it difficult to find games that are not popular at the moment. It may be easier to categorize the games into genres so users could find less known or older games easily.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Creativity:</strong> Twitch allows users to customize their profiles with their own skins, making the experience to interact with others memorable.

			<h2>BILL DEROUCHEY:SMARTSITE INTERFACE</h2>

            <br>
			Smartsite is UC Davis's portal to mangaging coursework. Instructors use this site to upload assignments, input grades, quizzes, announcements, and etc. Most professors and students I have met hate using this website. This is an example of bad design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the website is functional in performing basic tasks, reliability and usability are lacking. The portal is powered by an open source software, so there are frequent crashes when it is heavily congested. This is inconvenient for everybody during finals week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Organization of tabs do not meet functionality in terms of what users are looking for. Buttons such as "Site Editor" and "Section" could be taken out. The numerous steps to turning in an assignment or posting a new forum topic as a professor is unnecessarily complicated.
The overall design is lacking proficiency because of the cluttered interface, which does not interact with users in innovative ways.

			<h2>EX 3: I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST FRIDAY</h2>
            <p>

            <p>
                Based on the movie, <em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>. The user can hover over the 4 different categories to see the different times. Categories are color coordinated, and a white bubble hovers overs the photo. This interface is engaging because it is easy to use, and well balanced in terms of visual hierarchy.

			<h2>EX 4: POCKET FULL OF INTERFACE</h2>
            <p>
			<img src="images/ex4.png" width="600" class="twitch">
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This interface is based off 5 random objects that I carry with me daily: keys, computer mouse, gum, pepper spray, and my wallet. The user can hover over the different buttons, and click to see what each of the items have to say. By creating colorful, large buttons, this immediately draw the user to cick/hover over the item. I chose to center all content above the fold so the user does not have to scroll down. The giant header in the video game style font complements well with the rounded buttons and the overall theme of the project.

			<h2>EX 5: THE LIBRARY- BACKSTRETCH</h2>
            <p>

            <br>
            <p>
                <a href="http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/" title="Backstretch">Backstretch</a> is a jQuery plugin that allows you to have a resizable slideshow of images set as your background on any webpage. This library is especially effective because users do not have to wait for a large image to download before using a site. Backstretch automatically resizes the image to any window size, properly fitting the image to the page or block-level element.
I chose this library because my final project will be an app for young adults to keep track of their house chores. I wanted to incorporate real images of clean interior shots fading in and out of the background as a slideshow.
